Although the lower part of the relief is missing, the scene is depicting a deity with long hair, wearing a polos hat, standing in the middle of a Doric temple, accompanied by bucranion on her/his left side and what appears to be an upper part of a club on the right side. In the middle of the temple’s pediment is located a round object, possibly the sun or a round shield.
